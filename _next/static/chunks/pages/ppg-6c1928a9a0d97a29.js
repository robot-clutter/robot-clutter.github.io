In such conditions, non-prehensile actions could help to increase such affordances. We propose a multi-fingered push-grasping policy that creates enough space for the fingers to wrap around an object to perform a stable power grasp, using a single primitive action. Our approach learns a direct mapping from visual observations to actions and is trained in a fully end-to-end manner. To achieve a more efficient learning, we decouple the action space by learning separately the robot hand pose and finger configuration. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that the proposed push-grasping policy achieves higher grasp success rate over baselines and that can generalize to unseen objects. Furthermore, although training is performed in simulation the learned policy is robustly transferred to a real environment without a significant drop in success rate.",abstract2:"The video and the images illustrate the different ways that a push-grasping primitive can create free space around an object in order to establish a stable power grasp in clutter. A proper push-grasping can roll-in an object within the palm of the hand and roll out or translate other objects away from the hand\u2019s closing region.",videos:["task.mp4"],summary_video:["ral_video.mp4"],example_videos:["e22_cropped_01.mp4","e10_cropped_02.mp4","e20_cropped_03.mp4"],example_videos2:["e17_cropped.mp4","e8_cropped_05.mp4","e23_cropped_06.mp4"],failure_videos:["e15_cropped_f1.mp4","e24_cropped_f2.mp4"],code:[{link:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9815129",alias:"IEEEXplore",type:"manuscript"},{link:"https://github.com/mkiatos/power-push-grasping",alias:"Github Repo",type:"code"}],bib:"@ARTICLE{9815129,\nauthor={Kiatos, Marios and Sarantopoulos, Iason and Koutras, Leonidas and Malassiotis, Sotiris and Doulgeri, Zoe},\njournal={IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters}, \ntitle={Learning Push-Grasping in Dense Clutter}, \nyear={2022},\nvolume={},\nnumber={},\npages={1-8},\ndoi={10.1109/LRA.2022.3188437}}"};a.Z=i},23057:function(e,a,n){"use strict";n.r(a);var t=n(26042),i=n(85893),r=n(9008),o=n.n(r),s=n(89604),p=n(25614),c=n(56950),l=function(){return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(o(),{children:(0,i.jsx)("title",{children:p.Z.title})}),(0,i.jsx)(c.Z,(0,t.Z)({},p.Z))]})};l.layout=s.Z,a.default=l}},function(e){e.O(0,[771,947,793,488,774,888,179],(function(){return a=43084,e(e.s=a);var a}));var a=e.O();_N_E=a}]);
